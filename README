This is a software framework to control the Novation Launchpad when it's not
being used for making music.  When I'm not DJing with it, I like to use it to
display stuff like the current time.

Currently, there's no framework built (just a couple of test scripts).  That's
coming.

PLAN
====

First row contains quick access to 7 (selectable) plugins, followed by the
selector (the mixer button).

The grid and right side is completely available to the currently selected
plugin.

The selector is actually a plugin that lets you select plugins with the grid.
You can assign a plugin to one of the 7 quick slots by pressing the associated
button on the right-hand side.
